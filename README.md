# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a earthquake map based on the past 7 days of earthquake activity. The map shows all earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Users can hone in on major earthquakes (earthquakes with magnitudes of 4.5 or greater). Three map views are available.
